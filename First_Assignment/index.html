		<p>
			On a late September afternoon, Brook Park Community Garden buzzed with neighbors. Program Director Ray Figueroa held court on a central picnic bench.
		</p>

		<p>
			“This is what community gardens represent,” said Figueroa. He gestured to the 200-person turnout for the Big Bronx Sancochazo. “The potential for organic, grassroots community development happening. That's the real significance of community gardens.”
		</p>

		<p>
			A new licensing agreement puts that significance at stake.
		</p>

		<p>
			For 6 months, community gardens and the NYC Parks Department have waged legal battle over restrictive clauses in this year’s license that have left gardens fearful for their future.
		</p>

		<p>
			Green Thumb, the decades-old division of Parks that oversees community gardens, holds legal control over city gardens via short-term leases.
		</p>

		<p>
			“The license renewals happen every four years and always have small changes based on experiences from the previous four-year cycle - this cycle is no different,” said Dan Kastanis, Parks’ Press Officer.
		</p>

		<p>
			New York City’s Community Garden Coalition (NYCCGC) Executive Director Aziz Dehkan disagrees. He said this year’s license contains 20 amended clauses and exercises significantly more control than the previous agreement.
		</p>

		<p>
			“I think what the city wants to do is cookie cutter and gentrify the community gardens so they’re easier to manage,” said Dehkan.

		<p>
			Mike Young, Padre Plaza community garden president, said 40 of the 46 gardens in the South Bronx are hold-outs, fearing liability and termination.
		</p>

		<p>
			The license jeopardizes Mike Young’s summer workshop: a carpentry program for at-risk high schoolers. If he signs, Young worries about future liability.
		</p>

		<p>
			“The bottom-line was: if you don’t sign you’ll be locked out of your garden and you will not be permitted on city property. So now we’re getting threatened? That’s nice,” said Young.
		</p>

		<p>
			Figueroa’s concern is termination. Last winter, he failed to shovel his garden’s surrounding sidewalks. Exhausted, he concentrated on the heavily-trafficked side and hoped the city would recognize his “good faith effort.”

		<p>
			“The next day we were issued a violation from Green Thumb, and I blew a gasket,” said Figueroa.
		</p>

		<p>
			Figueroa refuses to sign a license that would leave him vulnerable to increased violations, leading to possible termination.
		</p>

		<p>
			NYCCGC’s legal team continues to negotiate with Parks, bolstered by a city council cohort.
			Figueroa doesn’t know how long negotiations will take, but he’s confident the remaining gardens won’t capitulate. The hold-outs are adamant about their right to a fair license.
