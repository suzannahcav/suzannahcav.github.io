		<h2> <p>According to data from 2012 (the most recent year available) Staten Island scores highest on all three parts of the standardized test. In a three-part total score, Staten Island scores almost 100 points higher than the runner up (Queens), and over 150 points higher than the city average. </p>

 					<p> “Test score in Staten Island tend to be higher in general,” said John Panus a New York City teacher and Columbia graduate student. “Staten Island usually benefits from smaller class sizes.” Staten Island also has the smallest number of SAT test takers. Although they have the highest borough average in all three parts of the test, Staten Island test takers only make up 6.5% of all test takers in New York City. </p>

 <h3>
Staten Island leads boroughs but pulls city average minimally due to low number of test takers.
